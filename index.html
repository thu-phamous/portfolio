    <p id="section1">
      I gained much of my experience in digital agencies. My responsibilities included creating
      websites, landing pages, ad banners, and social media content.
      I am strongly interested in front-end development. My first experience came when
      I had to build a website on WordPress for my employer, Datics Consulting.
      I realized how much fun it was and wanted to pursue more work in this area.
      I am completing a Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp at Le Wagon and aim to specialize
      in front-end development.
