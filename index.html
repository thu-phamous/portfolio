    I gained much of my experience in digital agencies. My responsibilities included creating websites, landing pages, ad banners, and social media content. I am strongly interested in front-end development. My first experience came when I had to build a website on WordPress for my employer, Datics Consulting. I realized how much fun it was and wanted to pursue more work in this area. I am completing a Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp at Le Wagon and aim to specialize in front-end development.
